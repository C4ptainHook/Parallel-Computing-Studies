# Parallel-Computing Studies

A series of algorithmic programs made in order to practice with technologies of parallelization

# Parallel Algorithmic Tasks

This repository contains practical tasks and experiments related to parallel computing in **Java** and **C#**, showcasing a range of multithreading and distributed computing techniques. 

Technologies used:
- **Java Threads** and **ForkJoinFramework**
- **C# Threads** and **Task Parallel Library (TPL)**
- **MPI standard** via **MPJ Express** (Java)

### Highlights

- **Multithreaded Billiard Simulation** *(Sprint 1)*: Each ball runs in its own thread; includes experiments with thread termination and priority.
- **Classic Concurrency Patterns** *(Sprint 2)*: Producer-Consumer, `join()` method, synchronized console printing, multithreaded student gradebook.
- **Matrix Multiplication** *(Sprint 3 & Sprint 6)*: Implementations using both tape and Fox algorithms (Sprint 3), and MPI-based parallelization using blocking and non-blocking communication (Sprint 6).
- **Text Analysis** *(Sprint 4)*: Parallel computation of word statistics and common words using Java's ForkJoinFramework.
- **Queueing System Simulation** *(Sprint 5)*: Multichannel queue modeling using thread pools and simulation of a warehouse management system.
- **Distributed Computing with MPI** *(Sprint 6)*: Matrix multiplication using point-to-point message passing with MPJ Express.
- **Web + Parallel Backend** *(Sprint 8)*: Server-side matrix multiplication exposed via a web application, considering both server- and client-side data sources.
- **Genetic Algorithm Optimization (C#)** *(Sprint 10)*: Parallelized solution to the 0/1 Knapsack problem â€” the most advanced implementation in this project.
